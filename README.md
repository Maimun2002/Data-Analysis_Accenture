# Data-Analysis_Accenture

I have recently participated in Accentureâ€™s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture.

Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture
Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions
Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
